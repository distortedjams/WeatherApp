Weather App

This is a simple weather app that uses the OpenWeatherMap API to display the current weather conditions of a specified location. Users can search for a city and state to get the current temperature, humidity, wind speed, and more. The app also displays a corresponding weather icon based on the current conditions. Built with React and Bootstrap.

To run the app locally, clone the repository and run npm install to install the necessary dependencies. Then run npm start to start the development server.

Enjoy!
